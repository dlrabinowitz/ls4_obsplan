Scripts and code to make La Silla QUEST obsplans for the next 30 days

The main script, make_plan, is in the scripts directory. It calls other
scripts and binary executables in the bin and scripts directory. Included
in the src is skycalc, freeware to determine observing circumstances for
any given site at any given time. Program get_fields reads the tesselation
file and creates the field schedule in the format expected by the LA SIlla
scheduler.

To use "make_sne_plan.csh" in the scripts directory, and updated ephemeris for
the nightly moon position may be required. This can be obtained from JPL Horizons:

 https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons

Make sure to configure the ephemeris output to have the same format as the
existing ephemeris at conf/moon.ephem

to compile:

  NOTE: If using the scheduler to simulate observations, change the value of "FAKE_RUN" from 
  0 to 1 in "scheduler/src/scheduler.h" before compiling

  ./INSTALL.csh

to cleanup:

./CLEANUP.csh

to run:

  setenv MAKE_PLAN_ROOT to the path where this code was installed

  make a directory to store the obsplans
  change to that directory
  copy make_plan.csh from the scripts directory into the directory
  copy or link in the tesselation.dat file from the conf directory
  create an file of fields to exclude (same format as the obsplans themselves)
  run make_fields filename, where filename is the name of the excludes file

to test:
  setenv MAKE_PLAN_ROOT to the path where the code was installed
  cd $MAKE_PLAN_ROOT
  mkdir test
  cd test
  ../scripts/test.csh
